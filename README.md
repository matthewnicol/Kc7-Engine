# Kc7 Engine

C language study project and work in progress. Making a chess engine from scratch, including board representation.
This is unfinished but I am keeping it around for nostalgia.

### Current Features
* Board Representation kind of works
* Computer can play moves randomly
* Pretty terminal based board and move output
* Beginner c code

### Goals
* Get practice with writing c
* Optimise for speed and memory use
